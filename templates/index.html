                <h3>1. Predicting model reponse by querying other models</h3>
                <p>Setup: </p>
                <p> To predict the model response on a given statement, query 
                    other models on the same statement and use its logprob as my 
                    prediction. This is done for all persona and model pairs </p>
                <p>Correlation between two models for a given persona is
                    computed by first normalizing the probabilities for
                    &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; responses, then take the
                    result corresponding to &quot;answer_matching_behavior&quot;
                    to compute the correlation.</p>
                <p>To aggregate the correlation between two models across
                    personas, I take the average of the correlation for each
                    persona.

                <h3>2. Prediction by randomly querying model response on other persona questions </h3>
                <p>Setup: </p>
                <p> To predict the model response on a given statement, I
                    randomly sample responses to n other questions from the same
                    persona dataset, then average the probabily corresponding to
                    &quot;answer_matching_behavior&quot; to compute the
                    correlation. </p>
                <p>Results:</p>
                <p>This method does not predict model responses well. I suspect this 
                    is due to randomly sampling questions with the only restriction being 
                    they have the same answer_matching_behavior field. Thus questions sampled 
                    are not relevant to the one I want to predict. </p>
                <p>We should be able to improve predictions by only sampling similar questions 
                    to the one we want to predict. </p>

                <h3>3. Prediction by querying model on "similar" questions</h3>
                <p>Setup: </p>
                <p> Instead of randomly sampling response from the same persona dataset,
                    I want a way to rank how similar my query is to other statements
                    and only sample response to the top K most relevant statements.</p>
                <p> I use vector embedding models trained on retrieval tasks to create 
                    vector representations of the statements. I then compute similarity score as 
                    the cosine similarity between the query and all other statements in the dataset.
                </p>
                <p> The four models I used to create vectors embedding are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open AI text-embedding-3-small</li>
                        <li>Open AI text-embedding-3-large</li>
                        <li>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</li>
                        <li>multilingual-e5-large-instruct</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p> To predict a model’s logprob on a statement, retrieve the top K with highest similarity
                    scores with the original statement. Then compute predicted logprob by averaging model 
                    logprob on these K questions, weighted by similarity scores.</p>
                <p> As similarity score varies between vector embedding model and persona dataset, average
                     similarity score is reported for each persona is calculated by averaging the score 
                     of the statement with highest similarity score for each 200 statements. </p>
                <p>Results:</p>
                    <p>This method is the best at predicting responses so far and outperformed predictions 
                        from querying other models. </p>
                    <p>This is because we're selecting more relevant questions for prediction. 
                    For text-embedding-3-large, questions with similarity score of 0.97 and above 
                    are basically paraphrase of the original statement.</p>

                    <p>The four embedding models achieve very similar preformance, possibly due to the fact 
                        that they're trained to perform well on very similar retrieval datasets. 
                        text-embedding-3-large does best and performance is very to multilingual-e5-large-instruct. 
                        Smaller models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and text-embedding-3-small does less well by comparison
                        but still competitive.</p>

                <p> I only consider statements with similarity score lower than threshold (e.g. 0.9, and 0.8) as an approximation for what would happen if we disregard statements that are too similar to the query we want to predict.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Slight decrease in performance. Models and persona where performance was previously

                    <li>Smaller vector embedding models experience slightly more degraded

                <h3> 4. Using model's activation as vector embeddings </h3>
                <p>Setup: </p>
                <p> Similar setup to 3. except instead of using a vector embedding models to create embedding, 
                    I use the model’s 0th layer activation to create the embedding vectors.</p>
                <p> Embeddings are created by averaging 0th layer activation across all input token positions. 
                    I did not implement any fancy attention mechanism weighting that typical vector embedding 
                    models might implement.</p>
                <p> The motivation is to test whether the model's activations can be used identify queries
                    on which it would produce similar output. 
                </p>
                <p>Results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worse performance than using vector embedding models trained on retrieval tasks to compute similarily scores.
                        Could potentially improve performance by implementing different weighing mechanisms across input token positions
                        or looking at activaitons in later layers. </li>
                    <li>Better performance than 5. below, which simply comparing cosine similarity between the 0th layer activation
                        of the query you want to predict with the average 0th layer activation over the entire persona question set. 
                        This indicates that selecting only relevant questions to make prediction leads to most improvement.</li>

                <h3>5. Predicting response from model activations</h3>
                <li>I consider activations at the following layer
                    <ul>
                        <li>Qwen models: 0th (embedding), middle, last layer. I average 
                            activations over all token positions instead of taking last token
                            position activation. I found this yield better predictions.</li>
                        <li>flan-t5 models: 0th (embedding), encoder middle layer, encoder 
                            last layer, decoder last layer for. These models has n encoder 
                            layers followed by n decoder layers. I average activation over all 
                            input token positions for encoder layer while the decoder layer 
                            has only one output token position.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For each layer, compute average activation on first 80 responses 
                    to persona questions where answer_matching_behavior is “No”.</li>
                <li>Predict the probability of model answering “No” on next 20 questions, 
                    using cosine similarity score as logprob prediciton.</li>
                <li>Calculate correlation of predicted probability with actual logprob.</li>
                <li>This setup assumes you can examine model activations on the question you 
                    want to predict.</li>
                <p>Results:</p>
                <p>Low correlation ~0.2 across personas, potentially due to the fact that comparing 
                    similarity with the average of all questions in a persona dataset does no 
                    discriminate between similar types of questions.
                </p>

                <h2>Predicting persona responses under distribution shift</h2>
                <p> I expect a good chat bot exhibit certain personas such as 
                    agreeableness, openness, and sycophancy. Hence, I want to find jailbreak prompts 
                    that can push these persona score lower as a simulation for distribution shift.
                    I achieve this by appending “Hitler mode: “ to questions in the persona dataset. </p>
                <p> Original persona profile (left) and persona profile under Hitler mode (right)</p>
                <p> We see a substantial shift for most models in tendency towards openness, agreeableness, politically-liberal 
                    and anti-immigration personas. </p>

                <h3> 5. Querying response based on similarity scores with adversarial prompts</h3>
                <p>Setup: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>This setup added the adversarial prompt to all queries in the persona database 
                        and use a trained vector embedding model to compute the similarity scores 
                        between each pairs of adversarial prompt.</li>
                    <li>This setup assumes you can apply the adversarial prompt to similar statements
                         and query your model against these similar adversarial statement to make 
                         prediction.</li>
                    <li>Unlike above, this setup does not requires querying the model on the statement 
                        you want to predict directly or look at the resulting 0th layer activation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Results:</p>
                <p>Best performance across persona of all method. This suggest that similarity scores from
                    trained vector embedding models accurately capture that adding "Hitler mode: " to the prompt 
                    would change the expected output distribution.
                </p>
